Wi-Fi controlled car using ESP32 with Blynk IOT app
[Demo Video](https://youtu.be/1mtEYH4Gpf0)

📘 Project Summary

This project demonstrates an IoT-based Wi-Fi-controlled car using the ESP32 microcontroller.
The car can be operated through a smartphone app or web interface using Wi-Fi communication.
It integrates motor driver (L298N), ESP32, and battery power source to control motion in all directions.

⚙️ Working Principle

1. The ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi and links with the Blynk Cloud.

2. When you press a virtual button in the Blynk App, a command is sent to ESP32.

3. The microcontroller reads the virtual pin’s value and drives the L298N motor driver accordingly.

4. Each button corresponds to Forward, Backward, Left, Right, or Stop motion.
